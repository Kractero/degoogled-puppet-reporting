# Puppet Report

Puppet Reporting but without Google. 

This project will probably never see deployment but it is intended to act as both an api and frontend to get either the owner of a puppet or the puppets of the owner, as well as handle submissions and allow authenticated users to view active submissions and either approve or deny them.

Still needs:
- [ ] Sign up, although the one admin account is likely enough
- [ ] The ability to delete anything already in the database (not sure if this is done regularly enough on the sheet itself though)
